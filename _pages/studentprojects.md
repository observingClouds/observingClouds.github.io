### Improving aviation weather reports with machine learning

The weather has a strong impact on aviation. As a result, accurate weather reports are crucial for the safety and efficiency of flight operations both in-air and at the ground. Due to the importance of accurate weather reports, airports are often well equipped with meteorological instruments. The most common measurements include windspeed, wind-direction, temperature, visibility and cloud base height. These measurements are reported in [METAR reports](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/METAR), which are used by pilots and air traffic controllers to make decisions about flight operations.

The goal of this project is to improve the accuracy of the weather forecasts for selected airports by learning from historical METAR reports.
Based on the output of historical weather simulations and the METAR reports, a machine learning algorithm will be trained. The aim is to develop an algorithm that is able to provide added value to the weather forecast and provide more accurate predictions for the selected airports.
