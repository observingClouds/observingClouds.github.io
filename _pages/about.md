Hi, I'm an atmospheric scientist interested in understanding the Earth's climate system from as far south as Antartica to the North Pole. I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at the [University of Washington](https://atmos.uw.edu/) and NOAA PMEL on my [CICOES](https://cicoes.uw.edu/) funded project to improve our process-understanding of cloud organization. Prior to moving to Seattle, I did my PhD at the [Max Planck Institute for Meteorology](https://mpimet.mpg.de/en/homepage) in Hamburg and earned my degree from the University of Hamburg.

My research has taken me as far south as Antarctica to the German research station Neumayer III as an overwinterer, expanding my view on atmospheric processes beyond the norm and giving me the opportunity to collect and interpret climate data from this harsh and precious environment. It also has taken me as far north as Svalbard, where I was an ERASMUS exchange student at the [University Centre in Svalbard](https://www.unis.no/).

Firmly believing that observations play an important role in understanding our climate system, I have participated in several cruises in the Arctic and Atlantic and joined field campaigns like EUREC‚Å¥A in the tropics. As a long-time member of the [Tropical Cloud Observations group](https://mpimet.mpg.de/en/science/the-atmosphere-in-the-earth-system/working-groups/tropical-cloud-observation) at the MPI, I have worked with measurements from the [Barbados Cloud Observatory](https://barbados.mpimet.mpg.de/) and have been involved in the maintenance of this supersite since its early stages.

A major focus of my research has been shallow convection over the tropical and subtropical oceans. These clouds represent one of the largest uncertainties in future climate estimates and pose several challenges that drive my creativity and lead me to use observational data in unconventional ways, apply new methods such as neural networks, and perform large-scale simulations of mesoscale extents.
