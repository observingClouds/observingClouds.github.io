## Mission
Research is more than ever driven by data. However, on the oceans we still lack a lot of valuable insights. As a consequence, the uncertainties of our future climate projections can be largely attributed to our marine environment, in particular to the shallow clouds of the sub-tropical and tropical oceans. These clouds are very ubiquitous and reflective, but are too small to be resolved by current climate simulations. To measure processes on the order of 10-100km we need a dense network of measurement platforms. Traditional research vessels are limited in their numbers and too expensive to create such a dense array of stations. The same applies for buoys and autonomous platforms. The cruisers of the Atlantic Rally are a great fit to help us improve our knowledge about marine trade-wind clouds. The vast number of boats and the proximity thereof naturally build a mesoscale network of potential measurement platforms. In addition, they follow the trade-winds and therefore naturally capture the stratocumulus to cumulus transition that is still challenging to predict.
