## Mission
Research is more than ever driven by data. However, on the oceans we still lack a lot of valuable insights. As a consequence, the uncertainties of our future climate projections can be largely attributed to our marine environment, in particular to the shallow clouds of the sub-tropical and tropical oceans. These clouds are very ubiquitous and reflective, but are too small to be resolved by current climate simulations. To measure processes on the order of 10-100km we need a dense network of measurement platforms. Traditional research vessels are limited in their numbers and too expensive to create such a dense array of stations. The same applies for buoys and autonomous platforms. The cruisers of the [Atlantic Rally for Cruisers](https://www.worldcruising.com/arc/event.aspx) are a great fit to help us improve our knowledge about marine trade-wind clouds. The vast number of boats and the proximity thereof naturally build a mesoscale network of potential measurement platforms. In addition, they follow the trade-winds and therefore naturally capture the stratocumulus to cumulus transition that is still challenging to predict.

## Participation
Equipping hundreds of boats with meteorological instruments is a major undertaking. To make sure our instruments can withstand the harsh marine conditions we are planning to deploy only a few instruments for the ARC/ARC+ 2024. For this deployment we are currently searching for volunteering crews to join our team and take one measurement unit across the Atlantic.
